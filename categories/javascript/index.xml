I found some
suggestions on google to upgrade &lt;code>npm&lt;/code> but &lt;code>npm install -g npm&lt;/code> didn&amp;rsquo;t work either. After some
debugging and searching on npm repo issues, I finally found a temporary solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need the solution, you can go straight to &lt;a href="#solution" >Solution&lt;/a> and come back to read my findings later while npm doing what
it needs to do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why you should use Javascripts for scripting</title><link>https://sytranvn.dev/posts/why-you-should-use-mjs-file-for-scripting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sytranvn.dev/posts/why-you-should-use-mjs-file-for-scripting/</guid><description>&lt;p>I like to write small scripts, but used to suggle when I want to use Javascript
to fetch API data, or use some helper packages. Then I go with Python instead.
But things have changed. With the supports of ES module and &lt;code>fetch&lt;/code> and
&lt;code>node:module&lt;/code> API. It is much easier now since I feel more comfortable using JS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike normal &lt;code>js&lt;/code> files, node treats &lt;code>mjs&lt;/code> files as ECMAScript modules. So
it means you can use any supported ES-next features w/o a transpiler like Babel.
In the past, to be able to use ES features, we had to set up build and compilation
tools like Webpack and Babel (due to conflicts between common JS &lt;code>require&lt;/code> is
synchronous but &lt;code>import&lt;/code> is asynchronous, NodeJS didn&amp;rsquo;t support import/export
natively until node 13). Webpack and Babel are not ment to do the jobs of Node.
anymore. We should use them now when we need code bundling and compile some
other language to JS such as JSX or new ES proposals still in staging. And even
worse, sometimes they can even hold you back from using new features added to
Javascripts if you don&amp;rsquo;t configurate it at latest version. I have suffered so
many times that I can&amp;rsquo;t use &lt;code>...&lt;/code>, or &lt;code>Array.at&lt;/code> in my code just because my
project configuration is so outdated, not to mention the over advertised
Typescripts, migrating those tools just to use a natively supported feature is
pain in the a&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
