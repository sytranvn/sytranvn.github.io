      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really like cooking but unfortunately I am not a good cook. The only dishes I really know is Vietnamese&#xA;omelette egg with spring onion and boiled pork dip in fish sauce. I tried some other recipes before such as&#xA;Dong vermicelli, or meat poached but I can&amp;rsquo;t recall their recipes. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I don&amp;rsquo;t practice enough or the&#xA;recipes are so complex.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I want to make Pho for my wife and daughter. They went visiting my parents in law 3 weeks ago. And&#xA;they will fly tomorrow. My plan is making the broth first and keep it in fridge and boiling it again later.&#xA;This is the video I watched to learn to make Pho.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
