My daughter and my wife traveled the whole
country to contest chess championships. And I also traveled alone a couple of
times. We bought a DJI Pocket 3 so my wife can take as many moments of our
daughter as possible. We planed to also make vlogs out of it. But the plan was
just a plan. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have so much time to edit all those videos. And the
amount of videos just piped up as our daughter keeps contesting more and more
tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
