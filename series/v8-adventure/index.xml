In this part we still use our debug.js script. But we&amp;rsquo;ll add an other parameter to d8 before running process.
lldb -- d8 --parse-only debug.js With parse-only flag, we will forcus on how d8 parse source content and turn into lexical input elements.
Let&amp;rsquo;s add a breakpoint in v8::Shell::RunMain function and jump to it.

If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure if it will work, try it. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense, play with it until it does. If it&amp;rsquo;s not broken, break it. If it might not be true, find out.

Token Link to heading All tokens are defined by a macro TOKEN_LIST. It takes a list of 3 macros M all of which satisfy the same signature M(name, string, precedence), where name is the symbolic token name, string is the corresponding syntactic symbol (or NULL, for literals), and precedence is the precedence (or 0).</description></item><item><title>Build v8 from source on Apple M1</title><link>https://sytranvn.dev/posts/build-v8-from-source-on-apple-m1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sytranvn.dev/posts/build-v8-from-source-on-apple-m1/</guid><description>Follow up Build v8 from source on Ubuntu 20.04.

Why V8 and why from the beginning? Link to heading I&amp;rsquo;m working mostly as Javascript developer, but I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in C++ source code. V8 is perfect land for me to explorer interesting C++ concepts and to understand Javascript better. Current code base of V8 is huge, I cannot jump right into it and learn everything. So I decide to go back in time to see V8 in its initial shape.</description></item></channel></rss>
