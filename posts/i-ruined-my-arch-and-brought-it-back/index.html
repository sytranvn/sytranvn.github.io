i dont remember the exact command i used, but it seemed to be pacman -Rnc and something else i am not sure, and finally the package i wanted to remove. i started from the games group and everything was fine. then went to support tools, then office tools,&mldr; everything seemed fine. but unfortunately things were not as i expected. some widgets on the desktop stopped working. i decided to shut down the computer and go home. after dinner i sat at the table and turned on the computer. but oh no, things were clearly not working at all.
i couldn&rsquo;t get to the login screen, maybe the kernel had finished loading and was loading more system services but it stopped for a long time. i switched to tty2 with ctrl alt f2 and i could still log in to my account. at that time i didn&rsquo;t know what i did wrong, i just knew the next day i had important work to do and i needed this machine to work. i could use the terminal only for coding but not for chatting with colleagues.
by my guesswork i changed sddm config and tried between wayland and x11 but no go. worse i made it ugly. i lost access to tty2. now i cant edit from inside.
imagine in the middle of the night you are not doing anything useful, but have to fix the stupid mistake you just made. after a few reboots i still cant get into terminal. so i have to go get my spare usb to boot from usb.
it took me a while because i had previously hidden the usb from the boot menu, and now i had to rummage around to find that configuration again. after a while of trying, i was able to boot from the usb. it felt a bit more relieved at that moment.
then i tried arch-chroot to root and restore the error but after several attempts to install the configurations it still didn&rsquo;t work. finally gemini suggested reinstalling the kernel and i thought it was reasonable so i did it. i had to take screenshots with my phone and ask gemini to analyze the error then review that analysis and make a decision. finally after many hours of effort i restored my computer. overall everything is fine. only the sound doesn&rsquo;t work. some widgets don&rsquo;t work anymore so i decided to delete them. the most important thing is that it doesn&rsquo;t affect my work. today i solved the sound problem by reinstalling the sub packages that i found important in the plasma-meta package.
